<h1 id="01.00-introduction">1. Introduction</h1>
<p>In this book we&#39;ll be building a web application called Snippetbox, which lets people paste and share snippets of text – a bit like <a href="https://pastebin.com/">Pastebin</a> or Github&#39;s <a href="https://gist.github.com/">Gists</a>. Towards the end of the build it will look a bit like this:</p>
<p><img src="assets/img/00.00-01.png" alt="00.00-01.png"></p>
<p>Our application will start off super-simple, with just one web page. Then with each chapter we&#39;ll build it up step-by-step until a user is able save their own text snippets and view other people&#39;s via the app. This will take us through topics like how to structure a project, routing requests, working with a database, processing forms and displaying dynamic data safely.</p>
<p>Then later in the book we&#39;ll add user accounts, and restrict the application so that only registered users can save text snippets. This will take us through more advanced topics like configuring a HTTPS server, session management, user authentication and middleware.</p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This book is designed for people who are new to Go, but you&#39;ll probably find it more enjoyable if you have a general understanding of the Go syntax first. If you find yourself struggling with the syntax, the <a href="http://openmymind.net/The-Little-Go-Book/">Little Book of Go</a> by Karl Seguin is a fantastic tutorial, or if you want something more interactive I recommend running through the <a href="https://tour.golang.org/welcome/1">Tour of Go</a>.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also assumed that you&#39;ve got a (very) basic understanding of HTML/CSS and SQL, and some familiarity with working at the terminal (or command line for Windows users). If you&#39;ve built a web application in any other language before – whether it&#39;s Ruby, Python, PHP or C# – then this book should be a good fit for you.</p>
<p>In terms of software, you&#39;ll need a <a href="https://golang.org/doc/install">working installation of Go</a> (version 1.9 or newer).</p>
<p>We&#39;ll also use <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/">Curl</a> in a few places throughout the book to inspect the responses that our application sends. This should be pre-installed on most Macs, and Linux/Unix users should find in their package repositories as <code>curl</code>. Windows users can download it from <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html#Win32">here</a>.</p>

<h3>Conventions</h3>
<p>The code blocks throughout the book are shown with a silver background like below. If the code is particularly long, parts that aren&#39;t relevant may be replaced with an ellipsis. To make it easy to follow along, most of the code blocks also have a title bar at the top indicating the name of the file that we&#39;re working on.</p>
<div class="group"><div class="codeblock-title">hello.go</div>
<div class="codeblock go"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">package</span> <span class="nx">main</span>

<span class="err">···</span> <span class="c1">// Indicates that some existing code has been omitted.</span>

<span class="kd">func</span> <span class="nx">sayHello</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">fmt</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Println</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;Hello world!&quot;</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div></div><p>In contrast, terminal (command line) instructions are show with a black background and start with a dollar symbol. These commands should work on any Unix-based operating system, including Mac OSX and Linux. Sample output is shown in silver beneath the command.</p>
<div class="codeblock sh"><pre><span class='prompt'>$</span> echo "Hello world!"
<samp>Hello world!</samp>
</pre></div><p>If you&#39;re using Windows, you should replace the command with the DOS equivalent or carry out the action via the normal Windows GUI.</p>
<p>Some chapters in this book end with a <em>notes</em> section, which contains information that isn&#39;t relevant to our application build, but is still important (or sometimes, just interesting) to know about. If you&#39;re very new to Go, you might want to skip these notes and circle back to them later.</p>
